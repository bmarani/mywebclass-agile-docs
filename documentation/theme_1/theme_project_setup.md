# Theme 1.0: Creating a basic functional webpage with a privacy policy
## Overview
The objective of this project is  developing a basic website that includes essential 
features such as a homepage, navigation menu, contact form, and other relevant pages. 
In addition to the website itself, the theme includes the creation of a privacy policy 
that outlines how the website will collect, store, and use user data. The goal of this 
theme is to provide a solid foundation for a website that is both functional and compliant
with legal and ethical standards for user privacy.

## Test plan
Functional Testing: Test the functionality of the homepage, navigation menu, contact form, and other relevant 
                    pages to ensure that they are working as intended.
                    Verify that all links and buttons are working and leading to the correct pages.
                    Ensure that the website is responsive and can be accessed from different devices and browsers.
Privacy Policy Testing: Verify that the privacy policy is included on the website and accessible to users.
                        Ensure that the privacy policy is clear, concise, and complies with legal and ethical
                        standards for user privacy.
Performance Testing: Test the website's loading time to ensure that it is fast and responsive.
Security Testing: Ensure that the website is using secure protocols, such as HTTPS, to protect user 
                  data and prevent unauthorized access.
User Acceptance Testing: Gather feedback from users and stakeholders to ensure that the website meets
                         their requirements and expectations.
