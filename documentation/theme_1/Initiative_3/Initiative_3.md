"Develop a basic webpage that meets user needs"

Description: [The initiative is to develop a webpage with basic functionality. 
             The webpage is likely to be a key component of a broader project 
             or product offering, and its success will depend on how well it functions
             as well as how secure it is for the user.]

Goals: [To create a webpage that is easy to use 
       and navigate,To develop a webpage that aligns with the project 
       objectives, including design, content, and functionality ]

Scope: [The scope of this initiative is to create a basic webpage that accurately
       represents the learned objectives, is easy to navigate, and is optimized 
       for search engines. The webpage will consist of several sections, including a 
       homepage, few tabs.]

Outcomes: [create a basic webpage that is functional, Increased online presence, ]

Deliverables: [Design mockups and wireframes: This deliverable will include a set of
              design mockups and wireframes that outline the structure, layout, and look 
              and feel of the webpage.
              Deployed and launched webpage: This deliverable will be the final product 
              - a fully deployed and launched basic webpage that accurately represents the
              brand or product, is easy to navigate, and is optimized for search engines.]

Milestones: [Create wireframes and mockups of the webpage layout (1-2 weeks),
            Develop and test website functionality, including creating HTML/CSS templates (2-3 weeks),
            Create and edit website content, including text and images (1-2 weeks) ]

Constraints: [Technical constraints such as the availability of web development resources, 
             Time constraints such as the need to launch the website by a specific deadline ]

Assumptions: [The webpage will be developed using common web development
             tools and frameworks, 
             The target audience for the webpage has a basic level of digital literacy]

Risks: [Technical issues: There is a risk that technical issues could arise during
       the design, development, or deployment phases of the project. 
       This could include server downtime, unexpected bugs, or compatibility issues with 
       different browsers and devices.To mitigate this risk, the project team will conduct thorough testing at each stage of the project
       There is a risk that delays in content creation and curation could impact the project
       timeline. To mitigate this risk, the project team will establish clear deadlines and
       communication channels for content creation]

Dependencies: [design and branding guidelines, server and hosting infrastructure]

Team: [Web designer: responsible for creating the design mockups and wireframes for the webpage
      Web Developer: responsible for coding the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript required to build the webpage.
      Quality Assurance Specialist: responsible for testing the webpage at each stage of development to 
      ensure that it functions as expected
      Server Administrator: responsible for setting up and maintaining the server and hosting infrastructure]

)

## Test Plan:
Functionality Testing: Test all the links, buttons, forms, and other interactive elements 
                       on the webpage to ensure they are working as expected.
Usability Testing: Conduct usability testing to ensure that the webpage is easy to navigate,
                   the content is readable, and the design is aesthetically pleasing.
Performance Testing: Test the webpage's loading speed, page response time, and server uptime
                     to ensure that it is performing optimally.
Automated Testing: The webpage will be tested using automated testing tools, such as Selenium,
                   to ensure that the webpage functions correctly across different devices and browsers.
