"CI/CD Pipeline"

Description: [Set up CI/CD pipeline for a webpage that can
             help the team develop and deploy code quickly and efficiently.]

Goals: [Establish a streamlined CI/CD pipeline
       Facilitate collaboration and communication
       Improve code quality and stability
       Increase efficiency and productivity]

Scope: [create and implement a CI/CD pipeline for a basic webpage. The pipeline should automate the build,
       testing, and deployment process to ensure code quality, stability, and scalability.]

Outcomes: [Faster Time-to-Market
          Increased Code Quality and Stability
          Improved Collaboration and Communication]

Deliverables: [A fully functional CI/CD pipeline that automates the build, 
              testing, and deployment process for the basic webpage.
              Documentation outlining the configuration and usage of the CI/CD pipeline, 
              including guidelines for testing, version control, and deployment.]

Milestones: [Design and configuration of the CI/CD pipeline
            Integration with version control system and initial testing
            Deployment of the basic webpage to a staging environment
            Implementation of automated testing and code quality checks
            Deployment of the webpage to a production environment]

Constraints: [Time constraint and budget constraint]

Assumptions: [The development team is familiar with version control 
              and agile development methodologies
              The basic webpage has a stable and functioning codebase 
              that can be easily integrated into the CI/CD pipeline.]

Risks: [technical risk, to mitigate the team should work on thorough testing and debugging
       resource risk, the team should work on assessing progress and adjusting timelines]

Dependencies: [version control, infrastructure and testing]

Team: [Devops engineer, web developer and quality Assurance]

## Test Plan:
Code Coverage: The CI/CD pipeline should include automated code coverage checks
               that measure the percentage of code that has been tested.
Unit testing: tests that verify the functionality of individual components of the webpage.
Integration testing: verify the interaction between different components of the webpage.
Security Scanning: should include automated security scans that identify vulnerabilities in the code.
Manual Testing: to identify any issues that may have been missed by the automated tests.
