"As a [developer], I want to [create the git repository] so that [collaboration is easy]."

By following this template, you can create user stories that are structured and easy to understand. To make the user story even more effective, you can add acceptance criteria that specify the requirements that must be met to consider the user story complete. Here's an example of a user story with acceptance criteria:

"As a customer, I want to view my order history so that I can track my past purchases."

Acceptance Criteria:

The git repository should have clear instructions and reflect the purpose of the project
the repository should be hosted on an accessible platform such as github
the repository should be easy to navigate.
